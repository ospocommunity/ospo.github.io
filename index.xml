      <description>I am very sorry to inform all OSPOers that the first &amp;ldquo;OSPO Summit 2022&amp;rdquo;, which was originally scheduled to be held on December 16, 2022, could not be held on that day due to the uncertainty brought about by the changes in the COVID-19 epidemic prevention policy. The preparatory team decided to postpone the holding. Choosing to hold it online, we think that goes against our original intention of organizing this conference: Face-to-face is still our most important way of communication.</description>

      <description>The organizing committee is sincere in its belief that attendees will not choose us unless there are strong reasons to do so. After all, this is not a period of limited resources, and there are plenty of invitations for open-source events and conferences. So why do we think you should take the time to participate in OSPO Summit, a first-time organized event?

      <description>People never do things for no reason, just as open source never happens for no reason. In that case, why do we spend the tremendous effort to run this summit during an epidemic? Let&amp;rsquo;s hear from the initiators.
Blocking offline activities is hindering the growth of open-source The various domestic anti-epidemic policies are significant barriers for every open-source activist. Long-term restrictions on cross-city transportation, such as airplanes and high-speed trains, make offline gatherings, which are very important for open-source projects, almost impossible.</description>
